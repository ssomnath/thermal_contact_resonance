Thermal Contact Resonance (TCR)
================================
This project contains the work performed for capturing the temperature dependence of viscoelastic properties of materials.

The viscoelastic properties of materials are measured using a popular technique called Contact Resonance imaging.

This code was developed to add the temperature component to the research through the use of self-heating AFM cantilevers
instead of conventional non-heating cantilevers.

The challenge was to incorporate electromagnetic actuation through Lorentz force actuation along with
self-heating through a single excitation signal and measure the material properties.
